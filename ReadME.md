# Proc2D Level Generation Tool for Unity

a Unity tool for procedural level generation using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm. Users provide simple tile assets and define rules, guiding tile placement. The tool dynamically assembles levels by analyzing constraints, ensuring coherent patterns and layouts, and enabling efficient creation of diverse and customizable game environments from modular components.

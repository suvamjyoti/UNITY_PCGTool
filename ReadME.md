---

### Some Known Errors:

1. Do not press **Reset** during generation, as this will mess up the algorithm, and it won't work then.

2. The **Load** button does not work at launch. You need to save a level after opening it to load it; it works only before the application is closed.

3. After exiting Edit Mode, the camera stays in orthographic mode in Vanilla Mode as well.

4. The **Generate** button does not work in Edit Mode if it is pressed before **Start**.
